Total budget capped at $1000 USD, fitting an upscale ($$$) level with ~$333/day. Intercity transport: Round-trip economy flight Seoul-Tokyo (~2-3 hour flight, $300 USD, off-peak autumn pricing for solo). Local transport: 3-day Tokyo Metro pass or IC card usage (~$15-20/day for solo subway/bus rides in a compact city). Food: Mix of budget convenience store meals, ramen shops, and one nicer izakaya per day (~$65/day, adjusted for solo traveler's lower sharing costs but Japan's higher food prices). Activities: Sports-focused (e.g., visit Jingu Baseball Stadium, sports museum, or autumn hiking; includes entry fees/tours ~$50/day, leveraging free parks/walking). Lodging: Mid-range solo hotel or capsule/Airbnb in central Tokyo (~$100/night for 2 nights, no sharing premium). Other: Souvenirs, tips, SIM card/data, minor incidentals (~$33/day; no visa needed for Korean national short stay). Assumes efficient solo travel patterns, current exchange rates (1 USD ~150 JPY), and seasonal mild weather without major events inflating costs. All categories sum to exactly $1000 USD.",
