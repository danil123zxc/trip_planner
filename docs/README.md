**Main architectural document** covering:
- Feature slice principles and organization
- Six core feature slices with detailed responsibilities
- Dependency management and interfaces
- Implementation strategy and phases
- Testing and deployment strategies
- Security and monitoring considerations

### 2. [Feature Slice Architecture](./feature-slice-architecture.md)
**Visual architecture guide** including:
- High-level system architecture diagrams
- Detailed slice component breakdowns
- Data flow and deployment architectures
- Interface contracts and API specifications
- Security and observability architecture

### 3. [Feature Slice Implementation](./feature-slice-implementation.md)
**Practical implementation guide** covering:
- Directory structure and code organization
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Dependency injection and testing strategies
- Migration path from current structure
- Best practices and guidelines

### 4. [Feature Slice Diagram](./feature-slice-diagram.txt)
**Text-based visual representation** showing:
- Complete system architecture
- Feature slice relationships
- Data flow patterns
- Deployment architectures
- Interface contracts

## Feature Slices Overview

### üö™ API Gateway Slice
- **Purpose**: RESTful API interface for the trip planning system
- **Key Components**: FastAPI application, request/response models, authentication, error handling
- **Dependencies**: Trip Planning Core

### üß† Trip Planning Core Slice
- **Purpose**: Central orchestration and workflow management
- **Key Components**: LangGraph workflow, state management, human-in-the-loop handling
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational)

### ü§ñ Research Agents Slice
- **Purpose**: Specialized AI agents for gathering travel information
- **Key Components**: Lodging, activities, food, transport, and safety agents
- **Dependencies**: Trip Planning Core

### üîç Knowledge Retrieval Slice
- **Purpose**: RAG pipeline for travel knowledge
- **Key Components**: Vector store, semantic search, document processing
- **Dependencies**: External Data

### üåê External Data Slice
- **Purpose**: Integration with external APIs and data sources
- **Key Components**: Amadeus, TripAdvisor, Reddit, Internet search, Geocoding
- **Dependencies**: None (external service integrations)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management Slice
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration and environment management
- **Key Components**: API key management, environment variables, service configuration
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational)

## Key Benefits

### üéØ Business Alignment
- Each slice represents a distinct business capability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to understand and maintain

### üîß Technical Benefits
- Independent development and testing
- Clear interfaces between components
- Scalable architecture
- Path to microservices migration

### üöÄ Development Benefits
- Parallel development by different teams
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Clear ownership and responsibilities
- Better code organization

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **trip-planning-core**: Establish workflow foundation
2. **config-management**: Set up configuration system
3. **external-data**: Implement basic API integrations

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
1. **research-agents**: Implement specialized agents
2. **knowledge-retrieval**: Build RAG pipeline
3. **trip-planning-core**: Integrate agents with workflow

### Phase 3: API Layer
1. **api-gateway**: Implement REST API
2. **Integration testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

## Getting Started

1. **Read the main design document**: Start with [Feature Slice Design](./feature-slice-design.md)
2. **Review the architecture**: Check [Feature Slice Architecture](./feature-slice-architecture.md) for visual understanding
3. **Follow implementation guide**: Use [Feature Slice Implementation](./feature-slice-implementation.md) for practical steps
4. **Reference diagrams**: Use [Feature Slice Diagram](./feature-slice-diagram.txt) for visual reference

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** the feature slice design
2. **Plan migration strategy** from current structure
3. **Set up development environment** for slice-based development
4. **Begin implementation** following the phased approach

## Questions and Support

For questions about the feature slice design or implementation:
- Review the detailed documentation in each file
- Check the implementation guide for practical steps
- Refer to the architecture diagrams for visual understanding

This feature slice design provides a solid foundation for scaling your Trip Planner project while maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities.
