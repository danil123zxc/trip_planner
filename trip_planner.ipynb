That said, the rooms are not really worth the money - pretty basic and rather ‘institutional’ without much, if any ambience at all. For stays of less than three days they do not offer room cleaning, the reason being ‘concern for the environment’ I for one am not buying this. I think it is just to save money and increase profit. There is no TV, but old-style turntable record players amd a collection of 33rpm vinyls of jazz stuff to borrow and play on them. It’s a wacky idea certainly that might apoeal to people with no memory of using them. The advertised laundry facility is tucked away in a side area, dingy and uninviting - on,y available 0700 to 2200, so not much use to some guests. Staff are pleasant and courteous and the lobby area is nice. But you can get better at this price.', 'The Mustard is a great find on the edge of retro Shimokit. A choice of rooms but all are well laid out, some very large by local standards (or, in some cases, by any standards - we had a large room with a courtyard on the second floor). Japanese style beds but comfortable. Above all, the staff are just magnificent, among the very best ever experienced: really cheerful and helpful, hugely accommodating. Marvellous place', 'Let\\\\\\'s start with the price: $250 a night. For $250 a night, I expect a spotless accommodation, a place I might want to relax in after a day of walking through Tokyo. Yes, even in expensive Tokyo, I think one should expect clean and comfortable. The Mustard Hotel is neither. The rugs throughout are filthy and stained, the walls are scuffed, the TINY bathroom smelled sour due to an old shower curtain. Then let\\\\\\'s jump to decor. A hotel is a hotel, it doesn\\\\\\'t need much, but the \"minimalist\" aesthetic really means stark white walls, zero art, and no place to put your suitcase. It felt like walking into a prison cell. A $250/night prison cell. They boast amenities. By that they mean an in-room turntable and records you can borrow. That\\\\\\'s it. Breakfast is not be bagel. We stayed three days. Three days of bagels. And coffee. Basically bread and water, which is, well, kinda like a prison. Come on. The area is WONDERFUL (thus the 2 stars).

The groundwork took 13 years until 1700, but since then the garden has retained most of its original appearance across the Edo period (1603-1868) until the present day. The garden was used as a retreat as well as a place for entertaining guests, although people of the fiefdom too could visit it on certain occasions. As time went by, successive daimyōs slightly modified the garden adding and removing hills, lawns, ponds and buildings, but the initial concept of Korakuen as a wide, bright space offering beautiful inner and outer vistas remained constant and unaltered. In 1884, the ownership of Korakuen was transferred to Okayama Prefecture and the garden was opened to the general public: since then it is carefully managed as a historical cultural asset to be passed down to future generations.\\', web_url=\\'https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298134-d321203-Reviews-Okayama_Korakuen_Garden-Okayama_Okayama_Prefecture_Chugoku.html?m=66827\\', address_obj=Address(street1=\\'Korakuen 1-5\\', street2=\\'\\', city=\\'Okayama\\', state=\\'Okayama Prefecture\\', country=\\'Japan\\', postalcode=\\'703-8257\\', address_string=\\'Korakuen 1-5, Okayama 703-8257 Okayama Prefecture\\'), latitude=34.667408, longitude=133.93614, website=\\'http://okayama-korakuen.jp/\\', rating=None, price_level=None), photos=PhotosOutput(data=[PhotosData(id=\\'443309069\\', caption=\\'岡山後楽園 つつじと沢の池\\', published_date=\\'2019-12-29T01:17:36.891Z\\', image=Image(height=848, width=848, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6c/5c/0d/caption.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'382051648\\', caption=\\'春の幻想庭園  2019年4月26日 - 5月6日\\\\nGenso Teien - Spring Fantasy Garden  April 26 - May 6 \\', published_date=\\'2019-03-13T05:13:45.723Z\\', image=Image(height=851, width=851, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/c5/a5/40/2019-4-26-5-6-genso-teien.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'356853660\\', caption=\\'秋の幻想庭園\\', published_date=\\'2018-11-06T12:30:10.882Z\\', image=Image(height=850, width=850, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/15/45/27/9c/caption.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'443311230\\', caption=\\'岡山後楽園 2月 芝焼き\\', published_date=\\'2019-12-29T01:46:08.143Z\\', image=Image(height=848, width=848, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6c/64/7e/2.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'443311112\\', caption=\\'岡山後楽園 2月芝焼き\\', published_date=\\'2019-12-29T01:45:03.142Z\\', image=Image(height=834, width=834, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6c/64/08/2.jpg\\'))]), reviews=ReviewOutput(data=[ReviewData(id=\\'1027990083\\', lang=\\'en\\', location_id=\\'321203\\', published_date=\\'2025-09-01T07:19:33Z\\', rating=4.0, url=\\'https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298134-d321203-r1027990083-Reviews-Okayama_Korakuen_Garden-Okayama_Okayama_Prefecture_Chugoku.html?m=66827#review1027990083\\', text=\\'Korakuen is one of Japan\\\\\\'s \"\"Three Great Gardens,\"\" and its beauty is absolutely breathtaking.

We spent this autumn visit checking out the various borrowed scenery spots, especially the excellent views of Okayama Castle which towers over the garden.  We focused on out-of-the-way walking paths and smaller tea houses, and spent time photographing new angles on well-known locations or bypassing places with which we were all too familiar.  We enjoyed watching a tree technician up in the high canopy cutting down broken branches, a school group interacting with the koi, and a family outing to photograph their son and daughter celebrating Shichi-Go-San. \\\\n\\\\nThe vast expanse of lawn was covered with opened paper parasols, seemingly randomly placed, and probably for the autumn evening light-up, since each parasol had a light fixture under it.  This made for an intriguing daytime sight.  The parasols did add a new feature to a well known spot.  \\\\n\\\\nWe are not enamored of vast expanses of lawns and find this not the best feature of the garden and much of the garden IS a vast expanse of lawn.  We sometimes wonder what the basis for Korakuen being described as one of Japan’s three best landscape gardens.  We are not experts on this though we have visited many, many gardens in Japan over the course of our 30+ visits. \\\\n\\\\nWe prefer to photograph buildings and scenery without people.  We are willing to wait for those perfect moments without people and we certainly spent a lot of time waiting.  We had a pleasant chat with another photographer who admired our patience.  If you want people-free photos, the best advice we can offer is to arrive at opening time.  Because the garden is so large you would think the place you want to photo might be people-free some of the time, but it always seems that the place one wants to photograph has someone standing there shooting something else or just talking while admiring the plantings. \\\\n\\\\nVisitors tips:\\\\nExcellent soft ice cream cones are to be had at the small restaurant near the entrance/exit where you can also purchase food for the koi who look very well fed.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are over 65 be sure to ask at the ticket booth about the senior discount.

The gardens were first used by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The garden was built on the grounds of Edo Castle. It was used by feudal lords who came to stay at the castle.  The modern gardens were built in 1961. The gardens as we know them today were completed in 1968. There is a model in the garden of the once very grand castle. It was destroyed several times and finally was not rebuilt. The foundations are left and the walls surrounding the garden and some of the moat surrounding the garden speak to the history in this setting. There is also a small visitor center where one can see film footage of the current royal family. This is a beautiful setting in the middle of Tokyo. As it is the grounds of the home of the current emperor, it was worth a visit.

The groundwork took 13 years until 1700, but since then the garden has retained most of its original appearance across the Edo period (1603-1868) until the present day. The garden was used as a retreat as well as a place for entertaining guests, although people of the fiefdom too could visit it on certain occasions. As time went by, successive daimyōs slightly modified the garden adding and removing hills, lawns, ponds and buildings, but the initial concept of Korakuen as a wide, bright space offering beautiful inner and outer vistas remained constant and unaltered. In 1884, the ownership of Korakuen was transferred to Okayama Prefecture and the garden was opened to the general public: since then it is carefully managed as a historical cultural asset to be passed down to future generations.\\', web_url=\\'https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298134-d321203-Reviews-Okayama_Korakuen_Garden-Okayama_Okayama_Prefecture_Chugoku.html?m=66827\\', address_obj=Address(street1=\\'Korakuen 1-5\\', street2=\\'\\', city=\\'Okayama\\', state=\\'Okayama Prefecture\\', country=\\'Japan\\', postalcode=\\'703-8257\\', address_string=\\'Korakuen 1-5, Okayama 703-8257 Okayama Prefecture\\'), latitude=34.667408, longitude=133.93614, website=\\'http://okayama-korakuen.jp/\\', rating=None, price_level=None), photos=PhotosOutput(data=[PhotosData(id=\\'443309069\\', caption=\\'岡山後楽園 つつじと沢の池\\', published_date=\\'2019-12-29T01:17:36.891Z\\', image=Image(height=848, width=848, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6c/5c/0d/caption.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'382051648\\', caption=\\'春の幻想庭園  2019年4月26日 - 5月6日\\\\nGenso Teien - Spring Fantasy Garden  April 26 - May 6 \\', published_date=\\'2019-03-13T05:13:45.723Z\\', image=Image(height=851, width=851, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/16/c5/a5/40/2019-4-26-5-6-genso-teien.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'356853660\\', caption=\\'秋の幻想庭園\\', published_date=\\'2018-11-06T12:30:10.882Z\\', image=Image(height=850, width=850, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/15/45/27/9c/caption.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'443311230\\', caption=\\'岡山後楽園 2月 芝焼き\\', published_date=\\'2019-12-29T01:46:08.143Z\\', image=Image(height=848, width=848, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6c/64/7e/2.jpg\\')), PhotosData(id=\\'443311112\\', caption=\\'岡山後楽園 2月芝焼き\\', published_date=\\'2019-12-29T01:45:03.142Z\\', image=Image(height=834, width=834, url=\\'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/1a/6c/64/08/2.jpg\\'))]), reviews=ReviewOutput(data=[ReviewData(id=\\'1027990083\\', lang=\\'en\\', location_id=\\'321203\\', published_date=\\'2025-09-01T07:19:33Z\\', rating=4.0, url=\\'https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298134-d321203-r1027990083-Reviews-Okayama_Korakuen_Garden-Okayama_Okayama_Prefecture_Chugoku.html?m=66827#review1027990083\\', text=\\'Korakuen is one of Japan\\\\\\'s \"\"Three Great Gardens,\"\" and its beauty is absolutely breathtaking.

We spent this autumn visit checking out the various borrowed scenery spots, especially the excellent views of Okayama Castle which towers over the garden.  We focused on out-of-the-way walking paths and smaller tea houses, and spent time photographing new angles on well-known locations or bypassing places with which we were all too familiar.  We enjoyed watching a tree technician up in the high canopy cutting down broken branches, a school group interacting with the koi, and a family outing to photograph their son and daughter celebrating Shichi-Go-San. \\\\n\\\\nThe vast expanse of lawn was covered with opened paper parasols, seemingly randomly placed, and probably for the autumn evening light-up, since each parasol had a light fixture under it.  This made for an intriguing daytime sight.  The parasols did add a new feature to a well known spot.  \\\\n\\\\nWe are not enamored of vast expanses of lawns and find this not the best feature of the garden and much of the garden IS a vast expanse of lawn.  We sometimes wonder what the basis for Korakuen being described as one of Japan’s three best landscape gardens.  We are not experts on this though we have visited many, many gardens in Japan over the course of our 30+ visits. \\\\n\\\\nWe prefer to photograph buildings and scenery without people.  We are willing to wait for those perfect moments without people and we certainly spent a lot of time waiting.  We had a pleasant chat with another photographer who admired our patience.  If you want people-free photos, the best advice we can offer is to arrive at opening time.  Because the garden is so large you would think the place you want to photo might be people-free some of the time, but it always seems that the place one wants to photograph has someone standing there shooting something else or just talking while admiring the plantings. \\\\n\\\\nVisitors tips:\\\\nExcellent soft ice cream cones are to be had at the small restaurant near the entrance/exit where you can also purchase food for the koi who look very well fed.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are over 65 be sure to ask at the ticket booth about the senior discount.

The gardens were first used by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The garden was built on the grounds of Edo Castle. It was used by feudal lords who came to stay at the castle.  The modern gardens were built in 1961. The gardens as we know them today were completed in 1968. There is a model in the garden of the once very grand castle. It was destroyed several times and finally was not rebuilt. The foundations are left and the walls surrounding the garden and some of the moat surrounding the garden speak to the history in this setting. There is also a small visitor center where one can see film footage of the current royal family. This is a beautiful setting in the middle of Tokyo.

Used to be able to count on a good meal there. My burger was average at best overcooked, thin, no flavor. I think I received 8 fries as my side. My husband ordered a tenderloin. He used to brag about your tenderloins to people. Was small and a 6 at best he said. His side of tots never came. They were supposed to be “making them fresh”. The bartender gal after serving us never checked back. She would have known we needed drink refills or water and she would have seen my husband’s side never was delivered. We don’t mind paying higher prices for good food and service. This was not it. \\\\nPlease bring back a great chef/cook. I would take paper menus back in a heartbeat for great food.

Being a long time patron of the Local Eatery and Grill I could post stories that would make you gag but I will stick to most recent first hand. Recently we called in an order for take out. Two catfish dinners each with 2 sides. The person that took the order got the menu to confirm that it came with 2 sides at $13.98 each. The order was 2 catfish dinners; one with a side salad and fries. The other with baked potato and fried okra. When my husband arrived to pick up the order he was given a ticket for $45.98. He tried to talk to the cashier about the order without success. ( 2 x 14 would only be $28).  We he arrived home (we only live 3 miles from the Grill) my fries was cold and was charged $3 for extra fries and $10.98 for a house salad. His baked potato was yellowed and looked like it had been baked days ago and rewarmed.  And he didn’t even get the okra. I called back and spoke to a manager who said she couldn’t hear me good.  In the end, they didn’t charge us for the meal. However they ( the GM and the establishment itself) instead of being professional and just addressing the complaint, they did get on FB and make petty remarks about “bashing and false accusations”.  My complaint was neither bashing nor were there false accusations. How petty can a business be?  This is how they handle customer complaints.  The owners also own 3 other businesses in the area. You can google the reviews and find similar complaints on all their restaurants. (I always filter and start with the bad reviews as google usually puts them at the end).

Izakaya, run by \\\\nPeruvian chef Martín Rodríguez and positioned far from Cairo’s center, delivers in bursts but tempers its punches, adapting to Egypt’s notoriously cautious palate. Think of it as Nikkei-lite.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu itself reads well, filled with the promise of umami explosions and citrusy brightness. But what lands on the plate can feel restrained, like a chef forced to whisper when they should be shouting. The tiradito clásico hits the right notes: fresh, creamy, and sharp enough to cut through the noise. The tuna crispy sushi delivers a satisfying crunch and umami depth. The Josper corn ribs—charred, smoky, addictive—are an unexpected standout, while the gunkan hotate (scallop-topped sushi) and tuna foie gras feel indulgent without veering into chaos. However, some of the fusion sushi feels like a mishmash from the global “everything but the kitchen sink” trend: too many toppings, not enough cohesion. If you’re looking for purist Japanese restraint, this isn’t your spot—but if you’re game for creative excess, you’ll enjoy the ride.\\\\n\\\\nThe elephant in the room? The missing heat. There’s a noticeable absence of Peruvian ají chili in dishes where it should shine. And no wasabi with the sushi? A letdown. It’s hard to shake the sense that the boldest elements have been intentionally diluted.\\\\n\\\\nThe space itself is beautiful—sleek, modern, and designed for Cairo’s scenesters who want more than just dinner. By night, the vibe shifts to party mode, with a fully stocked bar (a rarity in Egypt) churning out cocktails. The absence of an international wine list is unfortunate, but we managed with a local white made from South African grapes, which did the job.\\\\n\\\\nService is attentive, and for a table of four with cocktails and a bottle of wine, the bill came to EGP 10,000. For a premium Nikkei experience, that’s not jaw-dropping—especially considering Izakaya is on the prestigious MENA 50 Best list (one of six Egyptian spots to make it).\\\\n\\\\nIs it worth the trek out of Cairo’s chaos? For dinner, drinks, and a lively night out, sure. But for those chasing an authentic, fire-breathing Peruvian-Japanese culinary adventure, this is more of a soft glow than a raging flame.\\', title=\\'Nikkei Vibes, Toned Down for the Local Crowd\\', trip_type=\\'Family\\', travel_date=\\'2024-12-31\\'), ReviewData(id=\\'978166081\\', lang=\\'en\\', location_id=\\'10135354\\', published_date=\\'2024-10-31T15:51:52Z\\', rating=5.0, url=\\'https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g8363967-d10135354-r978166081-Reviews-Izakaya-6th_of_October_City_Giza_Governorate.html?m=66827#review978166081\\', text=\\'A fantastic place to go!

       "  AIMessage(content='### Comprehensive Travel Recommendations: 8-Day Romantic Trip to Tokyo for John and Jane (October 1-8, 2025)\\n\\nAs a professional travel research specialist, I\\'ve conducted thorough research using reliable sources (including web searches, travel guides, and community insights from Reddit\\'s r/JapanTravel) to create a tailored plan for you, John and Jane—a couple of adults in your 30s—traveling from Seoul. Your 8-day trip (October 1-8, 2025) focuses on a romantic, relaxed experience in Tokyo, Japan, with a total budget of $3,000 USD for two people. This covers flights, accommodation, meals, local transport, attractions, and some extras, leaving room for spontaneity.\\n\\nTokyo in early October is ideal for couples: mild weather (average highs of 20-23°C/68-73°F, lows around 15°C/59°F), fewer crowds than peak seasons, and the start of autumn foliage. Expect comfortable days for walking hand-in-hand through parks and evenings with a crisp breeze. Public holidays are minimal (Sports Day is October 13, after your trip), but watch for Halloween events starting mid-month. No major visa requirements for short stays (assuming standard nationalities; confirm via Japan\\'s immigration site if needed). From Seoul, flights are short (2-3 hours) and affordable.\\n\\nI\\'ve prioritized romantic, couple-friendly activities: scenic walks, intimate dinners, and cultural immersion without overwhelming sightseeing. The itinerary assumes a moderate pace (4-6 hours of activities/day) to allow downtime. Total estimated cost: **$2,450 USD** (under budget, with $550 buffer for shopping/souvenirs or upgrades).\\n\\n#### 1. Flights: Seoul (ICN) to Tokyo (NRT or HND)\\n- **Recommendation**: Fly into Narita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) for convenience—Haneda is closer to central Tokyo (30-45 min by train). Roundtrip economy on low-cost carriers like T\\'way Air, Jeju Air, or Air Premia.\\n- **Best Options (based on current searches for similar October dates; prices fluctuate—book soon via Expedia or Google Flights)**:\\n  - T\\'way Air: ~$110-130 USD/person roundtrip (e.g., Oct 1 departure, Oct 8 return). Total for 2: **$220-260 USD**.\\n  - Jeju Air (with baggage): ~$150 USD/person. Total: **$300 USD** (recommended for checked bags).\\n- **Details**: Depart ICN early morning Oct 1 (arrive Tokyo ~11 AM). Return Oct 8 evening (arrive Seoul ~10 PM). Include 20kg baggage if packing layers for variable weather. No direct high-speed rail alternative from Seoul (flights are cheapest/fastest).\\n- **Tips**: Book with flexible cancellation. Use the Narita Express train from airport to Tokyo (~$20/person, 1 hour).\\n\\n#### 2. Accommodation: Romantic Stay in Shinjuku\\n- **Why Shinjuku?** Central, vibrant yet romantic—neon lights for evening strolls, easy access to subways, and couple-friendly spots like Golden Gai alleys. It\\'s walkable, with parks and izakayas for intimate dates.\\n- **Top Recommendation**: **Hotel Gracery Shinjuku** (Godzilla-themed but upscale; 8.3/10 on Booking.com, highly rated for couples on TripAdvisor).\\n  - **Details**: Superior Double Room (queen bed, city views, modern bath). Central location near Shinjuku Station.\\n  - **Cost**: $150-180 USD/night (including taxes; October rates stable). For 7 nights (Oct 1-8): **$1,050-1,260 USD**.\\n  - **Why Romantic?** Cozy rooms with deep soaking tubs (request one), rooftop bar for sunset drinks, and proximity to love hotels if you want a themed night out. Breakfast buffet included (Japanese/Western options).\\n- **Alternatives** (if Gracery books up):\\n  - Shibuya Hotel En: Trendy, near Shibuya Crossing (~$140/night; great for people-watching dates).\\n  - Richmond Hotel Premier Asakusa International: Quieter, historic vibe (~$160/night; near Senso-ji Temple for serene walks).\\n- **Booking Tip**: Use Booking.com or Agoda for free cancellation. Request a high-floor room for views.\\n\\n#### 3. Transportation in Tokyo\\n- **Public Transit**: Get a **Suica or Pasmo IC card** (~$20 preload/person) for seamless subway/train rides. Unlimited rides via Tokyo Metro Pass (24-hour: $5.50; 72-hour: $14/person).\\n- **Total Cost for 2**: **$150-200 USD** (includes airport transfers, daily subways, and one day trip).\\n- **Couple Tip**: Hold hands on the efficient (but crowded) Yamanote Line loop—it\\'s a fun way to sightsee.\\n- **Taxis/Uber**: Use sparingly for late nights (~$15-20/ride); apps like Japan Taxi work well.\\n- No need for JR Pass (your trip is Tokyo-focused; it\\'s overkill for 8 days).\\n\\n#### 4. Day-by-Day Itinerary: Romantic Tokyo Exploration\\nThis 8-day plan (7 full days + arrival/departure) balances must-sees, hidden gems, and downtime. Focus on walking, food, and intimacy. Adjust for energy levels—October\\'s weather is perfect for outdoor dates. Total attractions cost: **$150-200 USD** for 2 (many free).\\n\\n- **Day 1: Oct 1 – Arrival & Shinjuku Settle-In (Jet Lag Recovery)**\\n  - Morning: Fly from Seoul, arrive ~11 AM.

Ride the cable car for Mt. Fuji views (if clear), soak in an onsen hot spring (private bath ~$30 for 2).\\n  - Evening: Return by 7 PM; light dinner at hotel.\\n  - **Why Romantic?** Onsen dipping together is intimate (tattoos OK in private rooms).

Vegetarian options abundant; apps like Tabelog for reviews.\\n  - **Couple Tip**: Book a \"love set\" meal at a spot like Gonpachi (Kill Bill fame) for ambiance.\\n\\n#### 6. Budget Breakdown (for 2 People, USD)\\n- Flights: $250-300\\n- Accommodation (7 nights): $1,050-1,260\\n- Transport: $150-200\\n- Meals: $350-400\\n- Attractions/Activities: $150-200\\n- Misc (SIM card $20, tips $50, insurance $50): $120\\n- **Total**: **$2,070-2,530** (Buffer: $470-930 for extras like shopping or weather backups).\\n- **Savings Tips**: Eat at markets, use IC cards, book attractions online for discounts. Currency: Exchange to JPY (~150:1 USD); cards widely accepted.\\n\\n#### 7. Practical Tips for a Couple\\'s Trip\\n- **Health/Safety**: No COVID restrictions (as of now), but get travel insurance. Tokyo is very safe; English signage is good, but download Google Translate.\\n- **Weather Prep**: Pack layers (light jacket, comfy shoes for 10-15km walking/day). Umbrella for possible rain.\\n- **Events**: October 2025 highlights—Cosmos Festival at Showa Kinen Park (free flowers) or early Halloween in Shibuya (costume fun without crowds yet).\\n- **Sustainability**: Use reusable water bottles; Tokyo\\'s tap water is safe.\\n- **Custom Notes**: No specific interests listed, so I focused on universal couple appeal. If you share more (e.g., food prefs), I can refine. From Seoul, consider a multi-city pass if extending trips.\\n- **Next Steps**: Book flights/accommodation ASAP (prices rise closer to date). Use Hyperdia app for trains.\\n\\nThis plan captures Tokyo\\'s magic for a memorable anniversary-style getaway. If you\\'d like adjustments, more details, or bookings help, let me know!
