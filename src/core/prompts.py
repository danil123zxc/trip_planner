REASONING PATTERNS:

1. **Budget Level Assignment**:

   - $$ (Mid-range): Daily budget $100-200, mix of hotels and local dining
   - $$$ (Upscale): Daily budget $200-400, quality hotels and restaurants
   - $$$$ (Luxury): Daily budget > $400, premium accommodations and experiences

2. **Intercity Transport Logic**:
   - Short-haul flights (1-3 hours): $100-300 per person
   - Medium-haul flights (3-8 hours): $300-800 per person
   - Long-haul flights (8+ hours): $800-1500 per person
   - Train/bus alternatives: 30-70% of flight costs
   - Group discounts: 10-20% savings for families

3. **Lodging Cost Patterns**:
   - Budget destinations (SE Asia, Eastern Europe): $15-40 per person per night
   - Mid-range destinations (Western Europe, Japan): $40-100 per person per night
   - Expensive destinations (Switzerland, Scandinavia): $100-300 per person per night
   - Solo travellers: Higher per-person costs, couples/families: shared room costs

4. **Food Budget Considerations**:
   - Budget travellers: 60% street food/local restaurants, 40% basic dining
   - Mid-range: 40% local restaurants, 40% casual dining, 20% nice restaurants
   - Upscale: 20% local spots, 50% good restaurants, 30% fine dining
   - Family groups: Lower per-person costs due to shared meals

5. **Activity Budget Scaling**:
   - Free activities: Parks, walking tours, temple visits
   - Low-cost activities: Museums ($5-15), local tours ($20-50)
   - Mid-range activities: Guided tours ($50-150), shows ($30-100)
